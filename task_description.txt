Description of the task: 
The side Menu bar is used to give the user the ability to choose the drawing tool.
When you click on the "Pen" Icon, a popup shows up to take the configuration of the Pen from the user.
When you click on any drawing tool, it should take a different color (aqua in the attached image).
When the user clicks anywhere else, the popup should disappear.
BLOC pattern should be used for state management. you should use it to track the state of the Pen menu. (current color of the pen, current type & current thickness).
The exact icons are not mandatory, you can use any icons of your choice if it is hard to find the exact icon.
top right menu that shows a button to add new users, the users of the meeting and setting button. the functionality of these buttons is not required as part of the task (only the UI).
We expect a responsive screen that works properly on iPhone & Android (different editions).
